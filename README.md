- 👋 Hi, I’m Jam
- 👀 I’m interested in programming.
    - Focusing on building full scale meaningful projects for my portfolio (and for exposure to full stack)
    - Will work on mini projects on the way to help for reference
    - Will use these projects to help find a more challenging career
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced java techniques and practices
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects, maybe gaming
      - My first large scale project will be a bug tracker (Similar to JIRA)
      - Second large scale project will be to use that bug tracker to build something else (TBA).
